# YAGE - 2D Game Physics Engine

Reference book [Building a 2d Game Physics Engine: Using HTML5 amd JavaScript](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/building-a-2d/9781484225837/)

## TODO
- [] Colliding bodies change color to green
- [] When circles are rotated, their center line should rotate as well
